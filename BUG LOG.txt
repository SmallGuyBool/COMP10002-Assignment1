Current division bug:

When a subset is being chosen for the current division numerator,
if a carry is already present and the selection width needs to be increased,
the selection algorithm inserts an unneccesary 0.

EXAMPLES TO TRIGGER THIS BEHAVIOUR:
a=1111111111111111111
b=23
a/b
a?

FIXED!!!!!!!!!!!!!
