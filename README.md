# COMP10002-Assignment1

The goal of this assignment was to create an arbitrary (well if you consider a #define constant to be arbitrary) precision integer calculator.

In my submission, I implemented addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and integer (floor) division. The calculator _does_ have the capability to to subtraction, but it wasn't part of the assignment.
